/**
 * Foreground write-sandbox policy for locally launched background tasks.
 *
 * `pi-better-sandbox` owns the foreground policy and publishes an immutable
 * snapshot of it on `pi.events`. This module is the consumer side of that wire
 * contract: it mirrors the latest snapshot, and turns it into a confined
 * command at the moment a local task launches.
 *
 * Two rules make the behaviour predictable:
 *
 * 1. **Snapshot at launch, never a live reference.** The wrapped executable and
 *    argv are resolved once, when the task starts, and are what the task keeps
 *    running. A later `/sandbox off` or deny-rule change therefore reaches only
 *    tasks launched after it.
 * 2. **Opt-in, then fail closed.** `inactive` and explicitly `disabled` states
 *    launch unconfined. Once foreground policy says confinement applies, a
 *    missing or unusable backend blocks the launch and is never retried
 *    unconfined behind the operator's back.
 *
 * The contract is duplicated here rather than imported: `pi-better-sandbox` is
 * an optional peer that this package must keep working without. Two channel
 * names and a payload shape are the entire coupling, and both packages own
 * tests that pin them.
