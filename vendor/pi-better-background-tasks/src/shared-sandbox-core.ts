/**
 * OS-level write sandbox mechanism shared by Pi extensions.
 *
 * Legacy policies are write-only: a sandboxed process may READ anywhere and use
 * the network, but may only WRITE under a canonical root plus runtime paths.
 * Optional permissions add capability restrictions for reads, writes, launches
 * and network access. They cover known credential files, not OS keychains,
 * credential services, or tokens inherited in the child environment.
 *
 * This module owns the mechanism only: backend discovery, canonical path
 * containment, write-deny compilation, macOS SBPL profile construction, Linux
 * Bubblewrap mount construction, ordered executable/argv wrapping, and support
 * diagnostics. It owns no Pi tool, TUI, background-task, or subagent lifecycle
 * policy — callers decide when a sandbox is requested and what it may write.
 *
 * Every platform/filesystem dependency is reachable through the optional
 * `SandboxSeams` argument so callers can plan deterministically in tests.

/**
 * Give an absent denied path something the kernel can hold out.
 *
 * A mount needs a mount point. `--ro-bind-try` skips a source that does not
 * exist, so before this a denied path that had not been created yet was not
 * denied at all: inside the sandbox `echo secret > .env.local` simply created
 * it. `.env` and `.env.local` are absent in most projects, which made the
 * packaged defaults hold on macOS — SBPL denies by resolved path, existing or
 * not — and not on Linux.
 *
 * Nothing bubblewrap offers closes that without a mount point, and every
 * bubblewrap operation that would create one (`--dir`, `--file`, `--tmpfs`)
 * creates it through the read-write bind of the project, which is to say on the
 * real filesystem anyway. So the placeholder is created here, deliberately and
 * visibly, rather than as a side effect of a mount operation.
 *
 * An empty regular file is the least destructive placeholder: a later
 * `cp .env.example .env` overwrites it, where an empty *directory* at that path
 * would fail. Callers whose denied entry has to be a directory create it before
 * building the command, and an entry that already exists — file or directory —
 * is bound as it is. The file is created with O_EXCL, so anything that appears
 * in the meantime is bound rather than clobbered, and it is left in place
 * afterwards because a resumed task re-runs the launch vector it captured and
 * its `--ro-bind` sources have to still be there.
 *
 * Returns false when the placeholder could not be created. Callers must fail
 * closed for writable regions: a task may replace or chmod the blocking parent.
