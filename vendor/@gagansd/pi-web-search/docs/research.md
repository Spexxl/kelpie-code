# Multi-source search and Jev reference

[`multi_search`](../src/multi_search.ts) is opt-in concurrent retrieval, not a long-running research agent. External Jev judgment is a second opt-in. Ordinary `web_search` and `code_search` never run it. See the [package README](../README.md) for installation, retrieval defaults, credentials, and privacy limits.

## Enable multi-source search

Merge into the config file printed by `/web-search-settings`, then run `/reload`:

```json
{ "research": { "enabled": true } }
```

Call `multi_search` with a required query and explicit scope:

```json
{ "query": "AbortSignal.timeout", "scope": "both" }
```

`web` consults eligible Exa/Parallel sources; `code` consults eligible grep.app/Sourcegraph/GitHub sources; `both` sends the same query to both families. There is no `urls` parameter. Use identifiers/snippets rather than prose for code or mixed scope. Without retrieval keys, Exa, Parallel native MCP, grep.app, and Sourcegraph remain eligible. Check `/mcp` for native connection status; a same-name `pi_web_search_parallel` entry in `mcp.json` overrides the package server. Pi SDK embeddings must load Pi’s MCP and codemode extensions and call `bindExtensions()` (see the README).

Research appends family defaults to the configured preferences and runs all eligible sources concurrently. Empty fallback arrays do not exclude providers. Successful responses are concatenated, with source-index URLs deduplicated but same-URL hits retained. Within a live operation deadline, one failed source becomes a warning if another succeeds. All-source failure, caller cancellation, or a shared deadline expiring during retrieval fails the call, even after a sibling succeeded. Coverage is not agreement analysis or proof of exhaustive search.

Multi-source tool registration is fixed at extension load. Execution rechecks the current opt-in: disabling it without reloading makes an already-registered call fail with `invalid_config`. The settings report reads configuration; it is not a live tool-registration or provider-health test.

## Enable external judgment

Authenticate a classifier in Pi, then pin that exact catalog pair:

```text
/web-search-settings on
```

`on` enables multi-source search and judgment. It keeps an existing provider/model pin without checking other accounts. Otherwise, it selects a pin only when Pi reports exactly one available classifier. The command stops waiting after three seconds and requests cancellation. If discovery fails, settings stay unchanged. Select an exact provider/model to avoid discovery:

```text
/web-search-settings typesafe/jev-latest
```

`/web-search-settings off` disables judgment only. The command atomically merges nonsecret settings, preserves tuning, and refuses malformed files. It does not write credentials.

```json
{
  "research": { "enabled": true },
  "jev": { "enabled": true, "provider": "typesafe", "model": "jev-latest" }
}
```

Run `/reload` if research was not already exposed. Other judgment config changes are read next operation. Pi owns catalog, authentication, and `classify()`. See [classifier models](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/models.md#use-classifier-models).

**Data sent:** at most one judgment request contains the query and every retained candidate's index, title, URL, and complete provider-returned `citedText`. This happens before formatter preview caps and before safety suppression. All candidates share one request with relevance, off-topic, self-contained, safety, and set-sufficiency questions. Do not enable it for evidence you are unwilling to send to the selected external service. This is a heuristic, not a security firewall or verified-answer guarantee.

## Upgrade from 0.1.x

Old `jev.backend` settings no longer select a provider. Model names do not receive automatic alias changes.

1. Run `/web-search-settings` to check the current pin.
2. Select the matching command from the [provider table](../README.md#try-jev-with-your-existing-pi-login).
3. Run `/reload` if you enabled `multi_search`.

The command removes `jev.backend` and keeps other settings. Missing or unavailable pins return unjudged results with warnings. Ordinary searches need no classifier.

## All Jev settings

All fields are optional. This block shows the defaults; it deliberately leaves both opt-ins off:

```json
{
  "research": { "enabled": false },
  "jev": {
    "enabled": false,
    "provider": "",
    "model": "",
    "weights": {
      "answers": 0.45,
      "offtopic": -0.3,
      "selfcontained": 0.25
    },
    "safetyThreshold": 0.75,
    "maxStateChars": 24000
  }
}
```

| Field | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Only literal `true` enables judgment. Other values leave it off. Research must also be enabled to expose the tool that uses it; ordinary web/code tools never classify. |
| `provider` | Exact Pi classifier provider. Required with `model` when judgment is on. Empty means unpinned; retrieval is returned unjudged. |
| `model` | Exact Pi catalog identifier for that provider. No alias remapping. A missing or unavailable pair fails open with a warning. |
| `backend` | Deprecated and ignored. Old files keep loading; pin `provider` and `model` instead. |
| `weights.answers` | Weight for answer relevance. |
| `weights.offtopic` | Signed weight for off-topic score; default negative penalizes off-topic evidence. |
| `weights.selfcontained` | Weight for usability without missing context. |
| `safetyThreshold` | A non-safe classification is suppressed when its winning-choice probability reaches this threshold. Policy clamps it to `[0,1]`. It is **not** a minimum confidence required to admit a `safe` result. |
| `maxStateChars` | Skip judgment if query + candidate title/URL/excerpt string lengths exceed this budget. It measures JavaScript characters, not encoded request bytes or tokens. Retrieval is still returned. |

Finite numeric values are accepted for weights and the two numeric settings; bad known values default with warnings. Weights are not normalized to sum to one. Unknown Jev fields/weight names or malformed blocks fail as `invalid_config`. These settings are parsed in [`providers/config.ts`](../src/providers/config.ts); ranking/suppression policy lives in [`jev/judge.ts`](../src/jev/judge.ts).

There is no `jev.timeoutMs` config field. The judge has a fixed **8,000 ms request deadline**, limited by the remaining shared `timeoutMs` operation budget. Increasing `timeoutMs` does not increase that judge-specific deadline.

## Pi classifier ownership

This package never sends a classifier HTTP request or resolves classifier credentials. It calls `findOfType("classifier", provider, model)`, checks that exact pair in `getAvailableOfType()`, then `classify()`. There is no default model, gateway ladder, or local→cloud fallback. Authenticate in Pi; billing follows the pinned provider. Legacy `JEV_API_KEY` is not supported. Missing pin, unavailable model, malformed answers, provider failure, or a classifier deadline leave retrieval unchanged with a warning; caller abort remains fatal. Pi classifier usage is attached to the tool result; nested MCP usage is counted separately.

## Outcomes and limits

`jevStatus` in structured output and coverage distinguishes:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `disabled` | Not requested by this tool or config. Ordinary searches always use this status. |
| `unavailable` | Missing Pi classifier/credentials, service/malformed-answer failure, or a deadline during optional judgment. Retrieval remains, with warnings. |
| `skipped` | No candidates after enabling, or the state exceeds `maxStateChars` (with a budget warning). |
| `ran` | A response was processed; it does not certify complete or trustworthy judgments. |

Ranking is local weighted scoring; missing relevance scores use `0.5`. Confident non-safe classifications are suppressed, while uncertain/missing safety judgments can remain with safety-unverified warnings. There is no separate minimum safe-confidence gate. Missing sufficiency is treated as insufficient. Any suppression prevents a positive sufficiency claim for the surviving set because the global judgment saw the withheld candidates; survivors are not judged again.

When suppression occurs, aggregate provider prose and original provider warnings are conservatively withheld because they may quote suppressed content. Count-based notices, admitted results, citation audit URLs, and local config/input notices remain. This can hide otherwise useful upstream diagnostics. Structured `jev` records `sufficient`, `lowConfidence`, `suppressed`, and `suppressedUrls`; an unknown suppressed URL is reported as `(unknown)`, not the withheld title.

Missing Pi classifier/authentication, over-budget state, failures, and judgment deadlines **fail open** to the retrieved evidence, subject to normal output clipping. Genuine caller cancellation remains fatal. Jev does not guarantee truth, safe instructions, independence among sources, or agreement, and does not trigger another search. Inspect warnings and citations rather than treating `ran` or `sufficient` as a security decision. The implementation boundary is [`jev/augment.ts`](../src/jev/augment.ts).
